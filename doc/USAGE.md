# Usage instructions

The instructions below have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS.

## Dependencies

The toolchain includes the following components, where the versions
are the latest ones that we tested: 

- npm 8.19.2
- Truffle 5.7.1
- Solidity 0.8.17 (via solc-js)
- Node 16.17.0
- Web3.js 1.8.1
- OpenZeppelin Contracts Upgradeable (submodule) 4.8.0

## Installation

Clone the git repository, with the option `--recurse-submodules` to fetch the submodules:

`git clone git@github.com:CMTA/CMTAT.git  --recurse-submodules`  

We recommend to install the [Nove Version Manager
`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple versions of
Node.js on your machine. You can then, for example, install the version
16.17.0 of Node.js with the following command:

`nvm install 16.17.0`

To install the node modules required by CMTAT, run the following command
at the root of the project:

`npm install`

To use Truffle, the recommended way is to use the version installed as
part of the node modules, via the `npx` command:

`npx truffle`

Alternatively, you can install Truffle
[globally](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation/):

`npm install -g truffle` 

See Truffle's official [documentation](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation/) for more information.


## Testing

Tests are written in JavaScript and run with Truffle as follows:

`npx truffle test`

To use the global Truffle install, use instead `truffle test`.

Please see the Truffle [JavaScript tests
documentation](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript)
for more information about the writing and running of Truffle tests.


## Code style guidelines

We use linters to ensure consistent coding style. If you contribute code, please run this following command: 

For JavaScript:
```
npm run-script lint .
npm run-script lint:fix . 
```

For Solidity:
```
npm run-script lint:sol  
npm run-script lint:sol:fix
```

## Known bugs

The coverage with the library *solidity-coverage* [does not work anymore](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues/694).
