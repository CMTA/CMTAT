# Authorization Module

This document defines Authorization Module for the CMTA Token specification.

## Rationale

There are many operations that only authorized users are allowed to perform, such as issuing new tokens. Thus we need to manage authorization in a centralized way.
Authorization Module covers authorization use cases for the CMTA Token specification.
