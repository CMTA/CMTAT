# Contributing Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute to CMTAT Contracts.

## Opening an issue

You can [open an issue] to suggest a feature, a difficulty you have or report a minor bug. For serious bugs in an audited version please do not open an issue, instead refer to our [security policy] for appropriate steps. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.MD).

Before opening an issue, be sure to search through the existing open and closed issues, and consider posting a comment in one of those instead.

When requesting a new feature, include as many details as you can, especially around the use cases that motivate it. 

## Submitting a pull request

If you would like to contribute code or documentation you may do so by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.

Run linter and tests to make sure your pull request is good before submitting it.
