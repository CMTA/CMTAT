# CMTAT Token 

The CMTA Token (CMTAT) is a framework for ERC20-compliant token
implementing functionalities required to tokenize securities in
compliance with the Swiss law.
The CMTAT is an open standard from the the [Capital Markets and
technology association](http://www.cmta.ch/) (CMTA), and the product of
collaborative work by the leading organizations in the Swiss finance and
technology ecosystem.

The CMTAT allows the creation of two types of tokens:

* *CMTAT-E*, to tokenize equity shares of Swiss companies, in
  accordance with the [Blueprint](
  https://www.cmta.ch/content/52/cmta-blueprint-for-the-tokenization-of-shares-of-swiss-corporations.pdf)
  **TODO: add links to legal documents**

* *CMTAT-D*, to tokenize debt securities. **TODO: elaborate**
